Have you ever tried [slido](https://www.sli.do/) or [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)? So you know how useful are, for teaching or conferences, having audience interactive slides. But, you also love using your `xaringan` slides.

Now, thanks to `interactingan`, it is possible to incorporate interactive objects into your `xaringan` presentations!

(It can also be used with any other RMarkdown document that returns html results)

## Installation

`interactingan` is currently only available as a GitHub package.

To install it run the following from an R console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("jcrodriguez1989/interactingan", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Usage

### Creating a basic `interactingan` presentation

In RStudio click on *File* > *New File* > *R Markdown...* > *From Template*

Select **Interactive Ninja Presentation** and press **OK**.

This will open an `interactingan` presentation template, if you have already
configured your `rsconnect` account, then this template is ready to get 
**Knit**ted.
